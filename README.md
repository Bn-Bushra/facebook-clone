# Facebook Clone by Bn Bushra

This is a project embarked on to broaden my horizon on web development.

## Designing the User Interface

### User Interface Research

- Visiting Facebook and other social media to observe their UI design.
- Take note of elements of the news feed
- From my research I discovered that there are different layout design for the
  facebook web app. as there is one for mobile[https://m.facebook.com] and
  desktop[https://web.facebook.com]
- So I try to recreate the mobile version for large screens and make it responsive.
### Wireframing
- I'll need a navbar with six navigation button made with grid(flex)
- Then, to the "What's on your mind (creating a container for it)?" which contains the profile pics of the user, the what's on your mind bar, a photo selection icon and key updates icon.
- Then is the stories section, with the title 'stories aligned to the left and 'Your archive' to the right. and a then a carousel of stories with users display picture with a facebook blue thick outline.

### UX Experience Considerations

- intuitive navigation and ease of use
- clear communication of information and actions

### Visual design

- includes color scheme, typography, and visual elements

## Developing the Front-end

### HTML Structure

- Creating the HTML structure using the wireframe created earlier

### CSS styling

- applying CSS styles to enhance visual appeal of HTML elements

### Responsive Design

- creation of breakpoints using CSS media queries to adjust layout for different
  screen sizes.
